# === Kage Scan - AI / Vision Dependencies ===
# These packages are heavy (PyTorch, ML models) and may require special setup.
# Install AFTER the core requirements.txt is installed.

# --- PyTorch (CPU-only to save space, switch to cu121 for GPU) ---
# torch>=2.1.0
# torchvision>=0.16.0
# Install manually with:  pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# --- OCR ---
manga-ocr>=0.1.11              # Japanese OCR (requires PyTorch)
easyocr>=1.7.0                 # Multi-language OCR (KR, CN, EN)

# --- Text Detection ---
# comic-text-detector is NOT on PyPI. Install from GitHub:
#   pip install git+https://github.com/dmMaze/comic-text-detector.git
# Our code has a contour-based fallback if this is not installed.

# --- Inpainting ---
# iopaint has complex deps. Install separately:
#   pip install iopaint
# Our code falls back to OpenCV inpainting if this is not installed.
